Did you know?

Did you know girl?
Why the stars, they go to hide.
When you come out to stand on your balcony?

When you smile,
The sun peeps out of the shadows,
And when you weep the clouds,
They, cry with you!
You anger, makes the thunder,
Lightning storms your mood swings dear!

Did you know, my love?
You were so special....

The birds in the trees,
They sing when they please,
But when you're walking among them, they stop.
They want to sing you,
Only their best...
Only their best song?

Girl, did you know?
Why I love you so....

When you smile my heart trembles with fear,
Would I hurt you?
I don't want to...
Ever see a tear drop in your eyes...
Girl did you know??
