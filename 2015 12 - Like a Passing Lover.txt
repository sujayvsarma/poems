=====================================
Like a Passing Lover

=====================================

You said you need to study,
You said you wanted to make more money 
And then you found someone to marry...
And you decided to settle down...

You moved away, all the way...
Across the oceans I saw you go!
So far away, away from your family 
your friends, your schools and colleges
You moved away, to the other side of the world.

But then you changed!
All of a sudden..
You are now -- like a lover
Thrown away by a passing wind

Now you no longer, like me
You no longer... care
You say you're proud and post and share memes 
But when you come home,
You carry your own water and medicines
You say I make you sick
Dirty and downtrodden..
You say you don't want to see me 

In all my glory ... 
You prefer your narrow view
But then you changed!
All of a sudden...
You are like a lover,
Who has found another one.
