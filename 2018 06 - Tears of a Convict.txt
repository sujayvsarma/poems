Tears of Convict

=====================================
Staring out the window,
On the passenger side of the car,
Looking at the scenery
Rolling by too fast to see...
I raise my eyes with sorrow,
See the empty roads ahead,
Wonder when I will get my turn,
To fly once more across the land.

Its not to be today,
Coz today my parole ends.
I have to haul myself back to prison,
Waiting there until my sentence ends.
Meanwhile the driver of my car,
He mumbles something meaningless.
I look away to the other side,
And I see the birds flocking together.

Whizzing past a hundred miles an hour,
In another car, a little child waves and smiles at me.
I raise my hand to her in sorrow,
Coz I know that I can never be...

Tears of a convict,
Sentenced to life.
Tears of a convict,
Never to be free...
These are the...
Tears of a convict,
Who has sinned into life.
Tears of a convict,
Never, again to be happy!

Am lost to my reverie,
A distant thunder rolls.
Lights streak across the sky,
And my driver rolls up the windows,
Rivers of rain, run across the windows,
And the outside world darkens for a moment.
I heave a sigh of deep relief,
The world outside, as dark as my haven!

Tears of a convict,
Sentenced for life.
Tears of a convict,
Never again be free!
Tears of a convict,
A sinner of life,
Tears of a convict....
