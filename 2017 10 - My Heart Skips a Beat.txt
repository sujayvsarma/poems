My Heart Skips a Beat

=====================================

You make my heart,
Skip a beat,
When you talk,
I can feel.
I don't know why,
But it is true,
I think I am,
In love with you.

When I saw you far away,
I wondered what angels 
Brought you this way.
I prayed all night 
I should meet with you,
And it happened, tonight.

You make my heart,
Skip a beat,
You make me whistle,
When I sleep.
I dont know how or even when,
But I think I am,
In love with heaven.

I dont know if,
I can live..
Without you,
In my life.
But it is clear,
That what I have,
Is true.

When I saw you walk away,
On his arm,
Instead of mine.
I was angry and I was sad,
And this happened,
To bring you close again.

You make my heart,
Skip a beat,
You make me smile,
When I am sad.
I dont know if we are,
Meant to be.

You make my heart, (Oh dearest girl)
Skip a beat, (I love you so!)
You make me dance, (Why I don't know)
To strange music, (That I've never heard.)
In my life I need you dear, (Or I won't be around here,)
I love you. (I love you!)
