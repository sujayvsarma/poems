The Way you Look

=====================================

It's the way you look,
When you're lookin' at me.. 
I can tell you're thinkin' of me.

It's the way you laugh,
When you're holdin' my hand...
I can tell you're havin' a good time!

It's all good, baby!
It's just you and me... 
You said .. I love you... 
... and that's all matters to me!
