I Don't Miss You

=====================================

I don't miss you...
I don't miss you, because you're not in my heart.
I don't miss you, because I never liked you from the start.
I don't miss you, because you and I were never meant to be.
I was never yours and you were never mine!

I don't miss you, so don't look me up.
On Facebook, Twitter or email even.
I don't miss you, so don't ping me on
WhatsApp to ask me wassup?

I've already deleted you,
Blocked you,
Thrown away your contact number...
I don't have your email,
Or your coordinates,
Or hotline even...

I don't miss you, i don't like you,
Please go away.
Out of my life.

I don't miss you, i don't want you,
Never cared to see your face.

I don't miss you, because you're not in my heart.
I don't miss you, because I never liked you from the start.
I don't miss you, because you and I were never meant to be.
I was never yours and you were never mine!
