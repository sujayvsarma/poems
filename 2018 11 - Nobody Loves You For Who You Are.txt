Nobody Loves You For Who You Are

=====================================

Nobody loves you for who you are,
Everybody, they have their own agenda!
Girls they say, they like you for what you be,
Then they say, come don't be shy, change into me!

This girl I met, 
On the Internet,
She was not so shy and very friendly!
I went to meet her, 
Over dinner, 
She said, I'll be your sweet ol'lady!

I took her home, 
Fed her well and kept her warm at night,
The next morning when I woke up, 
We nearly had a big fight!

This girl you see, did not really love me,
For the man that I was!
She clearly wanted me to be,
Someone other than who I was.

Nobody loves you for who you really are!
Everybody, they really, have their own agenda.
Girls they say, they like you, for what you be...
Then they say, come don't be shy, change into me!

I bid that girl, 
Chased her away, 
Told her good bye,
After years of searching, 
Far and wider,
I found another pretty lie.

She was different, I could see, 
At first she wanted me to be,
Just the way I was, 
Since before the day,
I laid eyes on that pretty bee!

For a few years, we had some fun,
This girl and me,
Then one day, she said she wanted a child,
At first I let it be.

This girl you see, did not really love me,
For the man that I was!
She clearly wanted me to be,
Someone other than who I was.

Nobody loves you for who you really are!
Everybody, they really, have their own agenda.
Girls they say, they like you, for what you be...
Then they say, come don't be shy, change into me!
