Eternity of Different Fires

=====================================

Forged in different fires,
My heart floats free
Through Eternity.

It is one with our Lord 
And not of this world,
Mere mortals fail to 
Understand me.

And so alone, must I 
Pass through life,
Praying for urgent relief.

My heart is forged 
In a different fire,
Not from of this world
And now it is free!

Jesus is Love,
And Love is my prayer.
In Him I stay... 
Hold my hands dear!
Feel my heart,
It stands pure, without a doubt,
Close your eyes my love,
And trust in our Lord!
He won't let harm come 
Your way at all!
