=====================================
No More

=====================================

You were the last to say goodbye,
When you said those words, I couldn't cry,
No tears, are left for, this heart to weep,
No more pieces, of my world, to keep.

Broken into a million pieces,
Am today, the saddest man alive,
Life holds no meaning yet,
No Will for me, but for Jesus.

You were the last to say goodbye,
When you said those words, I almost died,
No strength is left, in my mind,
No more friends left, to grind.
