Girl of my dreams..

Before you came, into my life,
I made a thousand pieces of my heart. 
I gave them all away, one by one,
To every girl I met.

And then I met you.. you... you.. 

Girl of my dreams,
And I gave the last piece to you.. you... you... 

The last piece of my heart. 
The girls that came before,
They threw my hearts away,
You were the... only... one... 

You kept it safe, from rain and sun,
Because you were ... the... one.. !!!

Girl of my dreams,
Sweetness to my heart,
You're the one for me,
Coz you are the last ever one!

Before you came, into my life,
I had a thousand pieces of my heart.
Gave them all away, one by one,
Every ...girl.. I met..

Girl of my dreams,
Then I met you.. you... you... 
The last piece of my heart,
I gave it to you... you... you...
