I Don't Know

=====================================

I don't know where I am,
It's just somewhere far away,
Like a star far up in the sky,
I have this night far away to fly.

Around me a million lights twinkle,
They come from cars running away,
Scared and terrible from life's wrinkles,
Where only wind and water hold their sway.

I don't care where I go,
It's a place no one knows,
Like a rocket on diwali night,
I have this moment up to fly.
