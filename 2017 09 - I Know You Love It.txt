I Know You Love It

=====================================

I don't know what to say,
I loved being inside you.. 
I loved being your man. 

We've been on some, 
Really lovely rides..
I know you love it when I ride you.
I know you love it when I do things to you...

We've been together,
In places that no one else has been.. 
I know you love me so...
I almost saw tears glisten'n in your eyes.. 
When we said goodbye.

I don't know what to say...
I only know that I will miss you...
Your insides.. 
I know I will miss you...
I will miss being in your heart...
