Mother

She searched deep within her heart,
And wondered if she could say it.
She knew that he was there but,
Could she repeat it?

She searched deep into her soul, 
And thought about whether they could make it
She knew that she could be there but,
Could she ever accept it?

Deep inside her body, 
A life-form twisted freely,
She stretched out and kicked her within her belly,
She knew that soon she would be a mother but,
Could she ever take care of it?
