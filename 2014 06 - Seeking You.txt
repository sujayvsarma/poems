Its called cheating when you smile		CD A-G FED
Pointing at the sky you dial			A-G FED CA
A line that I cannot read			FG E F E D

Its called lying when you say			C# F G# F# F D# D#
Rising suns will make my day			G# F# F F# F D# D#
A heart that I cannot seek			C# G# F# F F# D#

Falling on my knees				F# F D# C# C#
I have come this far to seek			F F# G# F# F F# D# 
An answer... questions I dare not ask		F F# A# G# F# F G# F D# D#

In my hands I hold a wish			CDA GFGE
Your eyes may tell me to go and fish		AGF E FD
But romantic at heart, I am ... dear		FG EF E D C

Its called wishing when you sigh		CD A-G FED
Turning back to look at me			A-G FED CA
After you've walked on .. in front of me	FG EF D A GGFE

Its called loving when you run			C# F G# F# F F# D#
Back into my arms				G# F# F F# D#
From miles away .. when you see!		C# G# F# F F# G# D#
