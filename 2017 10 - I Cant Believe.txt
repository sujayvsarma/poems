I Can't Believe

=====================================

I can't believe, 
I took money,
To say goodbye, to you!

I can't believe,
You no longer stand 
Waiting for me, below!

I can't believe,
I will not have,
Those trips again, with you!

I can't believe,
That You and I,
Are over and done, forever!

There was a time,
When I'd have thought,
We'd be together, for all time...
But that time now is past and gone,
Will no longer come again,
I am sad it's true.

I can't believe,
I took money,
And said goodbye, to you!
I can't believe,
You looked back at me,
As I walked away from you.
