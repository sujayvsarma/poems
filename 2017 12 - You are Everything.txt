=====================================
You are Everything

=====================================

In my mind when I think of you,
You blow my mind 'cause it's not enough,
Only the heart has enough strength 
To hold you, dear

You have been my constant rock,
My ever northern pole star,
When you're with me, I fail to see,
The world around me...

I fell for you,
Hard in love,
And I still am,
Failing through....
I don't want, to hit the ground,
I want to be more in love...

When I kiss you,
I feel the skies,
You are everything to me 
That I left behind....

When you're with me,
I don't care who likes or smiles,
For I know that...
You, are always there!

I fell into you,
I don't know why,
And I still am 
Failing more...
I don't want this to ever end 
I want to be you

My love,
I betrothed my heart and my life,
To you, to this day 
Twelve years back,
Today I wish to renew that vow,
And tell you I want to begin again

I love you sweetheart
Even more
Now that we've been 
Through hell and fire
You've stood by me no matter what
Proving again you are the one!
