What do you know? 
Of the emotions inside of me.
My heart, its all aglow,
With feelings for you and me.
I wanted to know,
How far we could go,
Before we ran out of steam.
I wanted to fly,
High above the clouds,
Holding your hands close to mine.

What do you know?
Of the feelings rushing through my brain.
It's headier than falling down from a plane.
My mind... it's telling me to let go,
Losing you to anther fellow,
Is not my idea of longing for my dear one.

I was happy,
When you told me,
We had made a new life.
A little baby growing inside of you...
We would nurture each other, as she grew up,
Making us stronger than ever.

Then I woke up,
And you were gone.
Rudely thrown things left in my path.
Accusations and moral indignations,
Baseless fears and allegations...
Fighting to push me away...
I wanted to come back,
I wanted you in my arms.
I wanted to hold you,
And let you know we would be alright.

What do you know!
Of the feelings in my heart,
All aglow, 
With enough love for you and me...
What do you know...
