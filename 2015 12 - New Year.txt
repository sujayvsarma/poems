=====================================
New Year
© Sujay V Sarma, Dec 31st 2015
=====================================

And the day has come again,
For us to say "farewell !"...
A year has passed and we won again,
For us to say "hooray !"

In the morning, we will wake
A new day it will be... 
A new year is here for us to take
And make it how we want it to be!

And the day has come again,
For us to say "welcome !"...
A year has passed and we smile today,
For we have our battles won.

In the coming year, let's resolve...
To participate
In the making of our glory,
As mankind we will triumph!

And today the day is here,
The sun has set and the moon rises 
A year has passed and we will talk 
For a long time to come.

Let's right our old mistakes,
Let's our neighbor love!
Let's extend a helping hand,
Let's think about right and wrong.

For every day we breathe today,
It could be our very last,
And on this solemn day we pray,
That we make Life our caste.

I look to you on Facebook and say,
Happy New Year to you... 
A year of glory, health and wealth,
I say to you and you!
